# Stage 2 – Log & Rules Review

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Owner:** Codex

## Summary
- Firestore Emulator smoke test deferred (Java runtime missing on this host). See `stage2-smoketest.log`.
- Searched local Firebase function logs (`functions-log*.json`) — no entries found; box does not have cached function logs.
- No additional client logs exhibiting Firestore PERMISSION_DENIED patterns available in repo.

## Actions
1. Run Firestore emulator smoke test on environment with Java installed (admin/non-admin scenarios).
2. Capture emulator results and update `stage2-smoketest.log` accordingly.
3. Enable structured logging for future Functions runs to catch Rules violations (`firebase functions:log` after emulator tests or production monitoring).
